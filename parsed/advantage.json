Our designers are guided by one philosophy: Let the artwork to do the talking, not the frame design. When your guests say, \"Wow, what beautiful artwork!\" rather than \"Wow, what beautiful framing,\" you know it's a success. We frame the old-fashioned way and take great pride in seeing your project completed from beginning to end. Once the final touches are complete, your framed artwork is inspected by several sets of eyes before you take it home. We use the highest quality archival materials and we offer a 100% guarantee.",

This is, after all, a place to eat. Executive Chef&#160;Joshua Hasho creates an excellent selection of comfort food with attitude.

Chef Nicole Pederson's seasonal, rustic new American cooking quickly became the talk of the town since opening in November of 2012 and her flavorful plates continue to wow guests. The lauded restaurant celebrates the nature of discovery in every aspect of the restaurant, from using found objects in the decor to sourcing products from lesser-known local purveyors. Found's flexitarian menu reflects the new American palate and its shared plates style accommodates vegans, meat lovers, and everyone in between.",
