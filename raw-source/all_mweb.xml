Our designers are guided by one philosophy: Let the artwork to do the talking, not the frame design. When your guests say, "Wow, what beautiful artwork!" rather than "Wow, what beautiful framing," you know it's a success. We frame the old-fashioned way and take great pride in seeing your project completed from beginning to end. Once the final touches are complete, your framed artwork is inspected by several sets of eyes before you take it home. We use the highest quality archival materials and we offer a 100% guarantee.]]></description><discount><![CDATA[<p>10% off purchase when WildCARD is presented</p>]]></discount><instructions><![CDATA[]]></instructions><addr><phone>847-475-1535</phone><street>1712 Sherman Ave. Alley</street><city>Evanston</city><zip>60201</zip><latitude>42.0491112</latitude><longitude>-87.6820176</longitude></addr><contact><name/><phone/><email/></contact><available><value>Students</value><value>Faculty/Staff</value><value>Student Spouse/Partners</value><value>Contractors</value></available></vendor><vendor><name>art-institute</name><title>Art Institute of Chicago</title><email/><website>www.artic.edu</website><description><![CDATA[The Art Institute of Chicago is a world-renowned art museum housing one of the largest permanent collections in the United States.

Utilizing the ballet barre to perform small isometric movements set to fantastic music, Pure Barre is the fastest, most effective, yet safest way to change your body. Students see results in just 10 classes.</p>
<p>Pure Barre is intelligent exercise. The technique protects your joints as it does not involve any bouncing or jumping. Each strength section of the workout is followed by a stretching section in order to create long, lean muscle without bulk. The workout launches a full blown attack on the areas of the body all women struggle with: abs, hips, seat, and arms. It defies gravity by tapering everything in and lifting it up.</p>]]></description><discount><![CDATA[<p>1 month unlimited $175 ($225 value), redeemable in-studio</p>]]></discount><instructions><![CDATA[]]></instructions><addr><phone>847-491-6245</phone><street>910 Church St.</street><city>Evanston</city><zip>60201</zip><latitude>42.0484662</latitude><longitude>-87.68390929999998</longitude></addr><contact><name/><phone/><email/></contact><available><value>Students</value></available></vendor><vendor><name>red-7-salon</name><title>Red 7 Salon</title><email/><website>www.red7salon.com</website><description><![CDATA[<p>RED 7 SALON is a boutique hair salon in Evanston.

While touring the Italian countryside, they discovered a small, secluded family restaurant run by an elderly local woman named Sarpina. Gerry was so overwhelmed by how wonderful Sarpina's food tasted, that he volunteered to spend 2 weeks working, for free, as an assistant in Sarpina's kitchen. There he learned the secrets of authentic Italian cooking, which are used in Sarpino's restaurants to this day.</p>
<p>Sarpino's offers the highest-quality gourmet and specialty pizzas, authentic Italian pastas, calzones, hearty sandwiches and paninis, healthy fresh salads, succulent chicken wings, freshly baked garlic and cheesy breadsticks, desserts, and beverages.</p>]]></description><discount><![CDATA[15% off all orders]]></discount><instructions><![CDATA[]]></instructions><addr><phone>847-869-5555</phone><street>2428 Main St.</street><city>Evanston</city><zip>60202</zip><latitude>42.033702</latitude><longitude>-87.7073094</longitude></addr><contact><name/><phone/><email/></contact><available><value>Students</value><value>Faculty/Staff</value><value>Student Spouse/Partners</value><value>Contractors</value></available></vendor><vendor><name>seattle-suttons</name><title>Seattle Sutton's Healthy Eating</title><email>sshenorthshore@comcast.net</email><website>www.seattlesutton.com</website><description><![CDATA[<p>Seattle Sutton's Healthy Eating (SSHE), a family-owned, Illinois-based healthy meal replacement company offers a no-gimmick approach to convenient, healthy eating.
